            <p>SUPERGEEKS LAUNCHES NIGERIA’S FIRST ELECTRONICS</p>

            <p>RECYCLING PLATFORM</p>

            <p>On November 1st 2014,SuperGeeks
                will play host to Nigeria’s mobile and tech industry’s elite to celebrate the
                grand opening of the company’s first Customer Experience Centre. </p>

            <p><span>SuperGeeks</span> was formed in 2013 by
                true super geeks <strong>Sam Uduma</strong> and <strong>Edmund Olotu</strong> to
                address the demand for a more professional and organized customer service
                delivery system in the tech support and repairs industry</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Following the acquisition of major investment injection, the
                <span class=SpellE>SuperGeeks</span> HQ has been undergoing major construction
                for the last few weeks turning what was once a ‘walk-in’ service center into a
                state-of-the-art Customer Experience Center The new space represents a
                significant milestone for <span class=SpellE>SuperGeeks</span> and establishes
                a solid foundation to roll out all the other exciting products and services
                that contribute to the goal of revolutionizing the tech support industry in
                Nigeria. </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>One of such services is the <span class=SpellE>SuperGeeks</span>
                Gadget Swap scheme, where people can trade-in their old, faulty and unwanted
                appliances for cash or money-off vouchers towards a replacement product. This
                not only relieves the consumer of unwanted clutter but also goes a long way to
                solving the some of the problems associated with electronics disposal and
                recycling in Nigeria. The Gadget Swap scheme will be activated on the day of
                the launch and all attendees to the event are encouraged to bring their gadget
                clutter along with them and take advantage of this brilliant new service. </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>The doors will open to guests at 10:00 AM for refreshments,
                networking and a walk-through of the facility. From 1:00 PM, the doors will
                officially open to our customers to give them a chance experience our new space
                and test drive Gadget Swap.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>With more great new services to be rolled out next month,
                including <span class=SpellE>SuperGeeks</span> Gadget Protection (an extended
                warrantee service); November is definitely an exciting month for <span
