        One day I was waiting for a train in London when this announcement came over the station speakers: “Can a
        hygiene operative please attend the primary customer zone.” The message was repeated three times before an
        exasperated voice shouted, “Can a cleaner please come to the ticket office.”<br>
        <br>
        The point I’m trying to make is this: Modern corporate culture with its love of jargon and complex process can
        sometimes stop us getting the job done.<br>
        <br>
        Why ? Because the rational world of business often overlooks the fact that whatever our role – CEO, Director or
        Manager – we are all human with an in-built set of powerful skills such as imagination, emotional intelligence,
        intuition and common sense that can produce incredible results but are hard to quantify in a spreadsheet.<br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to help you transform your company’s culture by encouraging everyone from the Chairman down to use
        these essential human skills to make them even more effective at work.<br>
        <br>
        To do this we use the ‘Three Ps’: <em>Provocation. Pragmatism. Personality</em>.<br>
        <br>
        After we work with you and your team to gain everyone’s trust, we guide you on a journey to explore and discover
        different ways of thinking, behaving and achieving at work – at a pace you all feel comfortable with. </p>
